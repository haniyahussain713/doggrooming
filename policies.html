      <h3>Service Policies</h3>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h4>Grooming Assessment</h4>
        <p>When a dog is brought into the shop for grooming, an assessment of the dog and a review of the dog owner's requests are done before the owner leaves the shop. Every grooming service order is evaluated and an estimated time for all services is determined. The dog owner is given the final price estimate after the grooming assessment.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h4>Special Requests</h4>
        <p>Dog owners may bring in a picture of what "look" they are desiring for their dogs. We'll do our best to match your vision while keeping your pet's comfort and coat condition in mind.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="policy-item">
        <h4>Photography</h4>
        <p>All grooming service orders require that a picture is taken of the dog before and after completion of the grooming. These photos may be used on our social media or website.</p>

      <div class="policy-item">
