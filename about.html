        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Lucy's Dog Grooming and Day Spa was founded in September 2015 by Lucy Muddypaw, a passionate dog lover located in the Heights area of Houston. Lucy started her experience in the pet grooming business after talking with a friend that worked in the grooming industry. She began working out of her house and traveling to clients' homes, finding customers through Craigslist. Her friendly personality and high-quality work quickly led to business growth.</p>
        
        <p>In September 2015, she found a shop located in a nice part of town right next to a veterinary office and decided to make the jump. When demand increased, she convinced her sometimes bossy older sister, Elly, to become her business partner at the end of 2015. In August 2019, Elly decided to pursue becoming a veterinary doctor, so Lucy became the sole owner.</p>
        
        <p>Lucy has provided her services at multiple dog shows and brings that expertise to every grooming session. During the pandemic, business naturally slowed down, but Lucy had enough loyal clients to keep the business open. In 2023, Lucy was able to hire Amanda as a full-time groomer.</p>
